# Notion-App
Notion is a review app that lets users review businesses or other landmarks in a TikTok inspired video format.

## Why did I decide to create Notion?
I aimed to create a project that would enhance my understanding of Swift and have the potential to become a startup. I chose to develop a video review app, because I noticed that review apps like Yelp are not as engaging as most social media apps have become. They also cater to an older audience. My app, Notion, specifically caters to the younger generation who enjoy posting short videos. I was inspired by TikTok's full-screen, immersive video format. The app is far from finished, but It is a project I am often working on to improve.
